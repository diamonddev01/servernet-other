Some of the hardest things about the bot is its want to go wrong
Its not always easy to repair these issues
Keeping these issues Isolated is also an issues


Fixing the error of the bot usage thing was just changing the if bot statment to return only, DO NOT EDIT THIS IT WILL ERROR IMMEDIATELY

Fortuanatly it now seems to work correctly. I plan on working on some small upated before resetting the old bot again

The next issue to solve is global leveling, this will be... difficult.
