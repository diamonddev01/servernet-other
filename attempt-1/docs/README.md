# WARNING
This content was all written in an application called obsidian. The names of these files may be confusing or may make perfect sense however this is because they were not made to be read in both text form or even in some MD editors. If you want the best experience reading these notes use the provided file browsers or open up an application such as obsidian and use that to view the content of this directory. This may also have adverse effects on how this content displays on Github, which is why this file is almost 100% plain text/html. If you are having github rendering issues, feel free to try one of the listed solutions to read through the roadmap.

Some of the items (.canvas files) cannot be opened in any applications other than obsidian. These are all files to better visualise information, that are not required for the use of this documentation. Any file under a `Cards` directory is only made for canvas use, please understand they are not meant to be used for any form of documentation.

## Solutions:
*Try to use a renderer that supports HTML & MD, since some of these files contain both*<br><span style="color:green">Recommended (R)</span><br><span style="color:yellow">Usable (U)</span><br><span style="color:red">Avoid if possible (A)</span><br>
- <span style="color:green"><a href="https://obsidian.md" style="color:green;text-decoration:none">Obsidian (R)</a></span> <sup><a href="https://obsidian.md" style="color:green;text-decoration:none">obsidian.md</a></sup>
	- The entire docs were written using Obsidian, so this would be the recommended renderer and PR's to markdown files will be tested in Obsidian and Obsidian only.
- <span style="color:yellow"><a href="https://markdownlivepreview.com" style="color:yellow;text-decoration:none">Markdown Live Preview (U)</a></span> <sup><a href="https://markdownlivepreview.com" style="color:yellow;text-decoration:none">markdownlivepreview.com</a></sup>
	- This renderer was tested however may have some spacing issues (line separations not being displayed. If you want a fix to this use the find and replace of "\\n" to "\<br\>")

<sup>If you wish to add an editor as Usable, feel free to do so however peer review will be required</sup>
